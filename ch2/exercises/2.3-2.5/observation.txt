Observations:
The table-lookup version (Exercise 2.3) performs the best due to its precomputed nature.

The loop version (Exercise 2.3) is slower but simpler and avoids memory overhead from a table.

The shift version (Exercise 2.4) is the least performant, but it demonstrates a clear and consistent logic.
