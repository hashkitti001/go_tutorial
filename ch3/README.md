# Ch 3 Exercises

Exercise 3.1: If the function f returns a non-finite float64 value, the SVG file will contain
invalid <polygon> elements (although many SVG renderers handle this gracefully). Modify
the program to skip invalid polygons.

Exercise 3.2: Experiment with visualizations of other functions from the math package. Can
you produce an egg box, moguls, or a saddle?

Exercise 3.3: Color each polygon based on its height, so that the peaks are colored red
(#ff0000) and the valleys blue (#0000ff).

Exercise 3.4: Following the approach of the Lissajous example in Section 1.7, construct a web
server that computes surfaces and writes SVG data to the client. The server must set the Con-
tent-Type header like this:
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "image/svg+xml")
